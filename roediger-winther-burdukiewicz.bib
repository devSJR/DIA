  Abstract                 = {Author Summary{\textless}p{\textgreater}A major property of living cells is their ability to maintain mass homeostasis throughout cell divisions. It has been proposed that in order to achieve such homeostasis, some critical event(s) in the cell cycle will take place only when the cell has grown beyond a critical cell size. In the budding yeast {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Saccharomyces cerevisiae,{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} a widely used model for the study of the eukaryotic cell cycle, a large body of evidence indicates that cells have to reach a critical size before they start to replicate their DNA and to form bud, which will give rise to the daughter cell. This critical cell size is modulated by growth rate, hence by nutritional conditions and the multiplicity of genetic material (i.e., ploidy). The authors present a mathematical model of the regulatory molecular network acting at the G$_{\textrm{1}}$ to S transition. The major novel features of this model compared with previous models of this process are (1) the accounting for cell growth (i.e., the increase in cell volume); (2) the explicit consideration of the fact that cells have a nucleus and a cytoplasm, and that key cell cycle regulatory molecules must move between these different compartments and can only react or regulate each other if they are in the same compartment; and (3) the requirement of sequential overcoming of two molecular thresholds given by a cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclin and a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. The model was tested by simulating the processes during G$_{\textrm{1}}$ to S transition for different growth conditions or for different mutants and by comparing the results with experimental data. A parameter sensitivity analysis (i.e., testing the model predictions when parameters are varied), newly indicates that the critical cell size is an emergent property of the G$_{\textrm{1}}$ to S network. The model leads to a unified interpretation of seemingly disparate experimental observations and makes predictions to be experimentally verified.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

Fluorescent images (one for each of the color channels to be analyzed) are then acquired by conventional wide-field epifluorescence or confocal microscopy. This method uses the image processing capabilities of Cell-ID (, as updated here) and data analysis by the statistical programming framework R (), which we have supplemented with a package of routines for analyzing Cell-ID output.

Microscopy-based imaging is booming and the need for tools to retrieve quantitative data from images is urgent. This book provides simple but reliable tools to generate valid quantitative gene expression data, at the mRNA, protein and activity level, from microscopic images in relation to structures in cells, tissues and organs in 2D and 3D. Volumes, areas, lengths and numbers of cells and tissues can be calculated and related to these gene expression data while preserving the 2D and 3D morphology. Image cytometry thus provides a comprehensive toolkit to study molecular processes and structural changes at the level of cells and tissues.},

  Abstract                 = {Author Summary{\textless}p{\textgreater}DNA damages are daily cellular events. If such events are left unchecked in an organism, they can lead to DNA mutations and possibly cancer over a long period of time. Consequently, cells have very efficient DNA repair machinery. Many studies have focused on the different molecular factors involved in the repair machinery, neglecting to consider the spatial context where damage occurs. Therefore, little is known about the role the nuclear architecture might have in the DNA damage response. In this study, we introduce computer modeling and image analysis tools in order to relate the position of DNA damage markers to morphologically distinct regions of the nucleus. Using these tools, we show that radiation-induced damages locate preferentially in non-condensed DNA regions or at the boundary of regions with condensed DNA. These results contradict the current dogma that the molecular response to randomly generated DNA damages is independent of their nuclear locations. Instead, this suggests the existence of repair centers in the nucleus. Overall, our approach shows that nuclear architecture plays a role in the DNA damage response, reminding us that the nucleus is not simply a soup of DNA and proteins.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

  Abstract                 = {Author Summary The CRISPR/Cas9 immunity system has the potential to revolutionize medicine and biotechnology by enabling researchers to cut an organism{\textquoteright}s genomic DNA at precise locations. While Cas9 is perhaps the most versatile and easy-to-use technique for gene therapy developed yet, it is not perfect; the enzyme can also cut DNA at unwanted locations in an organism{\textquoteright}s genome. Cas9{\textquoteright}s off-target activity must be greatly minimized to further improve its utility. Here, we develop a system-wide, quantitative, physical model to better understand all the factors that collectively control Cas9{\textquoteright}s off-target cleavage. We solve for the unknown parameters using gene regulation data from our laboratory as well as structural, biochemical, and next-generation sequencing data from other laboratories. Using the model in several examples, we explain how Cas9 identifies on-target versus off-target DNA sites, depending on the guide RNA sequence, the Cas9 and crRNA expression levels, the organism{\textquoteright}s genome, and the organism{\textquoteright}s cellular growth rate. We then propose several rules for designing experiments with minimal off-target activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose Celiac disease (CD) serology requires analysis of tissue transglutaminase type-2 (TG2autoAbs), deamidated gliadin (DGAbs), and as reference endomysial autoantibodies (EmA). Total IgA assessment helps to determine IgA-deficient CD patients. The novel multiplex indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) technique CytoBead was used to develop the first quantitative one-step serological CD assay comprising both simultaneous IgA autoAb and total IgA testing. Methods CytoBead CeliAK detecting TG2autoAb, DGAb, EmA, and simultaneously total IgA uses fluorescent microparticles for antigen and antibody immobilization along with monkey-esophagus tissue sections on glass slides. The assay was interpreted visually by classical fluorescent microscopy and digital IIF using AKLIDES{\textregistered}. Overall, 380 samples (155 CD patients, 5 with IgA deficiency, 68 with cystic fibrosis, 59 with eye disease, 93 blood donors) were run for performance analysis. Data were compared with classical IgA autoAb analysis by ELISA and IIF. Results Comparing CD-specific IgA autoAb testing by CytoBead with classical IIF and ELISA, very good agreements for EmA, TG2autoAb, and DGAb were determined (Cohen{\textquoteright}s $\kappa$ = 0.98, 0.96, 0.85, respectively). The difference between multiplex and single testing revealed a significant difference for TG2autoAb testing only (McNemar, p = 0.0078). Four CD patients and 4 controls demonstrated TG2autoAb positivity by ELISA but were negative by CytoBead. Further, 140/155 (90.9 \%) CD patients demonstrated TG2autoAb levels above ten times the upper normal and all five IgA-deficient samples IgA levels {\textless}0.2 g/L by CytoBead. Conclusions The novel multiplex CytoBead CeliAK enables simultaneous CD-specific autoAb and IgA deficiency analyses comparable with classical testing by single-parameter assays. Thus, comprehensive CD serology by CytoBead can alleviate the workload in routine laboratories.},

  Abstract                 = {Supervised learning can be used to segment/identify regions of interest in images using both color and morphological information. A novel object identification algorithm was developed in Java to locate immune and cancer cells in images of immunohistochemically-stained lymph node tissue from a recent study published by Kohrt et al. (2005). The algorithms are also showing promise in other domains. The success of the method depends heavily on the use of color, the relative homogeneity of object appearance and on interactivity. As is often the case in segmentation, an algorithm specifically tailored to the application works better than using broader methods that work passably well on any problem. Our main innovation is the interactive feature extraction from color images. We also enable the user to improve the classification with an interactive visualization system. This is then coupled with the statistical learning algorithms and intensive feedback from the user over many classification-correction iterations, resulting in a highly accurate and user-friendly solution. The system ultimately provides the locations of every cell recognized in the entire tissue in a text file tailored to be easily imported into R (; ) for further statistical analyses. This data is invaluable in the study of spatial and multidimensional relationships between cell populations and tumor structure. This system is available at http://www.GemIdent.com/ together with three demonstration videos and a manual.},

  Abstract                 = {Intensity inhomogeneity (bias field) is a common artefact in magnetic resonance (MR) images, which hinders successful automatic segmentation. In this work, a novel algorithm for simultaneous segmentation and bias field correction is presented. The proposed energy functional allows for explicit regularization of the bias field term, making the model more flexible, which is crucial in presence of strong inhomogeneities. An efficient minimization procedure, attempting to find the global minimum, is applied to the energy functional. The algorithm is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively using a synthetic example and real MR images of different organs. Comparisons with several state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique. Desirable results are obtained even for images with strong and complicated inhomogeneity fields and sparse tissue structures.},

When pushing the limits of resolution and sensitivity noise has ever been a major issue. However, commonly used non-adaptive filters can do noise reduction at the cost of a reduced effective spatial resolution only. Here we present a new package adimpro for R, which implements the propagationseparation approach by (Polzehl and Spokoiny 2006) for smoothing digital images. This method naturally adapts to different structures of different size in the image and thus avoids oversmoothing edges and fine structures. We extend the method for imaging data with spatial correlation. Furthermore we show how the estimation of the dependence between variance and mean value can be included. We illustrate the use of the package through some examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We report the population structure and dynamics of one Escherichia coli population of wild mallard ducks in their natural environment over four winter seasons, following the characterization of 100 isolates each consecutive season. Macro-restriction analysis was used to define isolates variously as multi- or 1-year pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) types. Isolates were characterized genotypically based on virulence-associated genes (VAGs), phylogenetic markers, and phenotypically based on haemolytic activity, antimicrobial resistance, adhesion to epithelial cells, microcin production, motility and carbohydrate metabolism. Only 12 out of 220 PFGE types were detectable over more than one winter, and classified as multi-year PFGE types. There was a dramatic change of PFGE types within two winter seasons. Nevertheless, the genetic pool (VAGs) and antimicrobial resistance pattern remained remarkably stable. The high diversity and dynamics of this E.\hspace{0.167em}coli population were also demonstrated by the occurrence of PFGE subtypes and differences between isolates of one PFGE type (based on VAGs, antimicrobial resistance and adhesion rates). Multi- and 1-year PFGE types differed in antimicrobial resistance, VAGs and adhesion. Other parameters were not prominent colonization factors. In conclusion, the high diversity, dynamics and stable genetic pool of an E.\hspace{0.167em}coli population seem to enable their successful colonization of host animal population over time.},

They also form the basis of various techniques for detection and quantification of nucleic acids and proteins. Nucleic acid-based methods include hybridization assays, solid-phase PCR, sequencing, and trapping assays. Microbead assays have been improved in the past decades and are now important tools in routine and point-of-care diagnostics as well as in life science. Its advances include low costs, low workload, high speed and high-throughput automation. The potential of microbead-based assays therefore is apparent, and commercial applications can be found in the detection and discrimination of single nucleotide polymorphism, of pathogens, and in trapping assays. This review provides an overview on microbead-based platforms for biosensing with a main focus on nucleic acid detection (including amplification strategies and on selected probe systems using fluorescent labeling). Specific sections cover chemical properties of microbeads, the coupling of targets onto solid surfaces, microbead probe systems (mainly oligonucleotide probes), microbead detection schemes (with subsections on suspension arrays, microfluidic devices, and immobilized microbeads), quantification of nucleic acids, PCR in solution and the detection of amplicons, and methods for solid-phase amplification. We discuss selected trends such as microbead-coupled amplification, heterogeneous and homogenous DNA hybridization assays, real-time assays, melting curve analysis, and digital microbead assays. We finally discuss the relevance and trends of the methods in terms of high-level multiplexed analysis and their potential in diagnosis and personalized medicine. Contains 211 references. Figure ᅟ},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of different biomolecules is of prime importance for life science research and medical diagnostics. Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, VideoScan, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition. The multiplex real-time capability for tracking of changes under dynamic heating conditions makes it a useful tool for PCR applications and nucleic acid hybridization, enabling kinetic data acquisition impossible to obtain by other technologies using endpoint detection. The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a HEp-2 cell assay. Its adaptiveness and versatility gives VideoScan a competitive edge over other bioanalytical technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {AbstractBackground: For the serological diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases, a two-tier approach starting with sensitive antinuclear antibody (ANA) detection by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on HEp-2 cells followed by characterization of positive findings with different immunoassays is recommended. To overcome drawbacks of this approach, we developed a novel technique allowing the combination of screening and simultaneous confirmatory testing. For the first time, this creates the basis for second generation ANA testing.Methods: ANA and autoantibodies (autoAbs) to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), CENP-B, SS-A/Ro52, SS-A/Ro60, SS-B/La, RNP-Sm, Sm, and Scl-70 were determined by IIF and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively, and compared to simultaneous analysis thereof by second generation ANA analysis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (n=174), systemic sclerosis (n=103), Sj{\"{o}}gren{\textquoteright}s syndrome (n=46), rheumatoid arthritis (n=36), mixed and undetermined connective tissue diseases (n=13), myositis (n=21), infectious disease (n=21), autoimmune liver disease (n=93), inflammatory bowel disease (n=78), paraproteinemia (n=11), and blood donors (n=101).Results: There was very good agreement of second generation ANA testing with classical one by IIF and ELISA regarding testing for ANA and autoAbs to dsDNA, CENP-B, SS-B, RNP-Sm, Scl-70, SS-A/Ro52, and SS-A/Ro60 (Cohen{\textquoteright}s $\kappa${\textgreater}0.8). The agreement for anti-Sm autoAb was good ($\kappa$=0.77). The differences of both approaches were not significant for autoAbs to SS-B/La, RNP-Sm, Scl-70, SS-A/Ro60, and SS-A/Ro52 (McNemar{\textquoteright}s test, p{\textgreater}0.05, respectively).Conclusions: Second generation ANA testing can replace the two-tier analysis by combining IIF screening with multiplex confirmative testing. This addresses shortcomings of classical ANA analysis like false-negative ANA findings and lack of laboratory efficiency and standardization.},

  Abstract                 = {The increasing prevalence of automated image acquisition systems is enabling new types of microscopy experiments that generate large image datasets. However, there is a perceived lack of robust image analysis systems required to process these diverse datasets. Most automated image analysis systems are tailored for specific types of microscopy, contrast methods, probes, and even cell types. This imposes significant constraints on experimental design, limiting their application to the narrow set of imaging methods for which they were designed. One of the approaches to address these limitations is pattern recognition, which was originally developed for remote sensing, and is increasingly being applied to the biology domain. This approach relies on training a computer to recognize patterns in images rather than developing algorithms or tuning parameters for specific image processing tasks. The generality of this approach promises to enable data mining in extensive image repositories, and provide objective and quantitative imaging assays for routine use. Here, we provide a brief overview of the technologies behind pattern recognition and its use in computer vision for biological and biomedical imaging. We list available software tools that can be used by biologists and suggest practical experimental considerations to make the best use of pattern recognition techniques for imaging assays.},

  Abstract                 = {Colony-based screens that quantify the fitness of clonal populations on solid agar plates are perhaps the most important source of genome-scale functional information in microorganisms. The images of ordered arrays of mutants produced by such experiments can be difficult to process because of laboratory-specific plate features, morphed colonies, plate edges, noise, and other artifacts. Most of the tools developed to address this problem are optimized to handle a single setup and do not work out of the box in other settings. We present gitter, an image analysis tool for robust and accurate processing of images from colony-based screens. gitter works by first finding the grid of colonies from a preprocessed image and then locating the bounds of each colony separately. We show that gitter produces comparable colony sizes to other tools in simple cases but outperforms them by being able to handle a wider variety of screens and more accurately quantify colony sizes from difficult images. gitter is freely available as an R package from http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gitter under the LGPL.

  Abstract                 = {An increasing number of free software tools have been made available for the evaluation of fluorescence cell micrographs. The main users are biologists and related life scientists with no or little knowledge of image processing. In this review, we give an overview of available tools and guidelines about which tools the users should use to segment fluorescence micrographs. We selected 15 free tools and divided them into stand-alone, Matlab-based, ImageJ-based, free demo versions of commercial tools and data sharing tools. The review consists of two parts: First, we developed a criteria catalogue and rated the tools regarding structural requirements, functionality (flexibility, segmentation and image processing filters) and usability (documentation, data management, usability and visualization). Second, we performed an image processing case study with four representative fluorescence micrograph segmentation tasks with figure-ground and cell separation. The tools display a wide range of functionality and usability. In the image processing case study, we were able to perform figure-ground separation in all micrographs using mainly thresholding. Cell separation was not possible with most of the tools, because cell separation methods are provided only by a subset of the tools and are difficult to parametrize and to use. Most important is that the usability matches the functionality of a tool. To be usable, specialized tools with less functionality need to fulfill less usability criteria, whereas multipurpose tools need a well-structured menu and intuitive graphical user interface.},

  Abstract                 = {Antibody assessment is an essential part in the serological diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. However, different diagnostic strategies have been proposed for the work up of sera in particular from patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD). In general, screening for SARD-associated antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is followed by confirmatory testing covering different assay techniques. Due to lacking automation, standardization, modern data management, and human bias in IIF screening, this two-stage approach has recently been challenged by multiplex techniques particularly in laboratories with high workload. However, detection of antinuclear antibodies by IIF is still recommended to be the gold standard method for antibody screening in sera from patients with suspected SARD. To address the limitations of IIF and to meet the demand for cost-efficient autoantibody screening, automated IIF methods employing novel pattern recognition algorithms for image analysis have been introduced recently. In this respect, the AKLIDES technology has been the first commercially available platform for automated interpretation of cell-based IIF testing and provides multiplexing by addressable microbead immunoassays for confirmatory testing. This paper gives an overview of recently published studies demonstrating the advantages of this new technology for SARD serology.},

  Abstract                 = {Analysis of phosphorylated histone protein H2AX ($\gamma$H2AX) foci is currently the most sensitive method to detect DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). This protein modification has the potential to become an individual biomarker of cellular stress, especially in the diagnosis and monitoring of neoplastic diseases. To make $\gamma$H2AX foci analysis available as a routine screening method, different software approaches for automated immunofluorescence pattern evaluation have recently been developed. In this study, we used novel pattern recognition algorithms on the AKLIDES{\textregistered} platform to automatically analyze immunofluorescence images of $\gamma$H2AX foci and compared the results with visual assessments. Dose- and time-dependent $\gamma$H2AX foci formation was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (ETP). Moreover, the AKLIDES system was used to analyze the impact of different immunomodulatory reagents on $\gamma$H2AX foci formation in PBMCs. Apart from $\gamma$H2AX foci counting the use of novel pattern recognition algorithms allowed the measurement of their fluorescence intensity and size, as well as the analysis of overlapping $\gamma$H2AX foci. The comparison of automated and manual foci quantification showed overall a good correlation. After ETP exposure, a clear dose-dependent increase of $\gamma$H2AX foci formation was evident using the AKLIDES as well as Western blot analysis. Kinetic experiments on PBMCs incubated with 5 $\mu$M ETP demonstrated a peak in $\gamma$H2AX foci formation after 4 to 8 h, while a removal of ETP resulted in a strong reduction of $\gamma$H2AX foci after 1 to 4 h. In summary, this study demonstrated that the AKLIDES system can be used as an efficient automatic screening tool for $\gamma$H2AX foci analysis by providing new evaluation features and facilitating the identification of drugs which induce or modulate DNA damage.},
